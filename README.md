newTrackon is a service to monitor the status and health of existing open and public trackers that anyone can use.
It also allows to submit new trackers to add them to the list.

newTrackon is based on the abandoned [Trackon](http://repo.cat-v.org/trackon/) by [Uriel â€ ](https://github.com/uriel).

Hosted and tested only with Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. **To work correctly, it needs IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity.**
